This repository contains the implementation of several surface electromyography (sEMG) decomposition algorithms that were evaluated and compared using simulated HD-sEMG signals. These implementations support the experimental results presented in a manuscript currently under peer review.
The algorithms included in this repository were independently implemented by our research group based on descriptions in the original literature.
